# CoconutCalculator
A dumb coconut calculator that I made during English class. Might improve upon it and do more with it soon.

This will be improved upon in the future with a GUI and different forms of measurement. 
For now this is just a simple project that practices IF, ELSE statements.
In the future, I don't really know.
